Last week Mapzen [announced](https://twitter.com/mapzen/status/730782107685912576) that they included bike data in their OSM vector tiles. That's just what the doctor ordered
to continue on my path towards the perfect bike map that I [started on](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/13/how-to-make-a-bike-map/),
[explored routing](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/14/routing/) and [looked at improving OSM bike data](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/15/bike-data/).
Now that I don't need to extract bike data myself any more it is time to take these maps global. And maybe add some minor
improvements.

<!-- more -->
To make the bike map boils down to deciding what OSM roads, paths, etc to map and how to map them. And what contextual
information to display. The only choices we have to make is how to organize the bike related data that exists in open street maps. Let's be a little
radical! Our emphasis will be on safety and cycling comfort for the casual rider. 

We will emphasise separated cycletracks by making them brightest and thickest. Shared pedestrian/bike infrastructure will
get a separate colour and be a little bit thinner. Next we layer on designated bike infrastructure by prioritizing lanes
on residential roads, then "shared" residential roads, then residential roads, then lanes and "shared" designations on
increasingly busy roads. Lastly we add residential and larger roads. And we only label roads that we are actually interested in.

We allow some customization by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain types of infrastructure. By default, roads without
special bike designation are de-emphasized. 

For good measure we added basic land use categories to highlight possible destinations, and we add building footprints
for reference as available.
 
This scheme is geared toward the safety conscious and motor-traffic-adverse cyclist in North America. In Europe other
designations exist that might call for a different priority. MAMILs might want a different colour scheme altogether.

### Data Quality
The data for the map comes right out of Open Streets Map. That means that if something is missing or not right you can
just go and fix it! To make things a little easier when you are on a desktop computer, just "shift-click" where the problem
is and it will bring the open street map editor up for that position. You might have to log in first or create a free
account before you can help improve the bike map.

There is a bit of a lag between changes being made in open street map and them filtering down to the mapzen tiles so that
they will show up on the map on the map, so don't fret if things aren't up to date immediately.


### Global
<a href="/html/bike_global.html#13/52.3617/4.9051" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/amsterdam_bike.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
And this bike map is global. The quality of the map depends on the quality of OSM data, in the case of Amsterdam it makes
it abundantly clear why casual cyclists keep dreaming about the infrastructure in this city.

The choice of emphasis for the
maps are based on North America, or more narrowly Vancouver, where I live. So this might need adjusting for local context
to better fit local OSM conventions. Use the search bar and explore your region. 

### The Real Deal
<a href="https://ride.report" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/ride_report.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Sadly, all of this effort is really coming at things from the wrong angle. The best way to do this,
[as we outlined earlier](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/13/how-to-make-a-bike-map/), is to base a bike map
on how cyclists actually use the roads and pathways, instead of how they got classified in Open Street Map or what
municipalities think they should be classified. The problem is that we don't have that data. At least not yet. But
there are really cool efforts out there to get that data and make it available.
 
I really like the approach that <a href="https://ride.report" target="_blank">Ride Report</a> has taken. Strava works
reasonably well for recreational cyclists, but it does a terrible job at capturing where transportation cyclists go and
makes no effort in understanding their comfort level. Ride Report takes a different approach by automagically figuring
out what you are doing and recording your cycling trips. All without you ever having to press a "start" or "stop" button,
which is key if you want to understand where transportation cyclists go. On top of that it prompts you to simply rate your
bike trip once you are done, and you can do this easily from your lock screen. Then Ride Report aggregates the data
to produce stress maps, and possibly other important data that can guide infrastructure improvements.

In this day and age of data driven decision making I would really like more municipalities to support efforts like Ride Report
that generate real meaningful data on transportation cycling. And as a by-product one could take cycling maps to the
next level and add actual cycling usage and comfort.

### Issues
There are still some issues. Some bike infrastructure, for example OSM paths, only become visible at zoom level 13 or higher.
That's just the way the vector tile service works. Secondary roads are only visible at zoom level 12 or higher, and this
includes "bike boulevards". Cyclepaths are only visible at zoom level 11 or higher. If one wants to have high-level bike
maps one probably needs a dedicated vector tile service for bike infrastructure.

### Apologies
Since this is just a blog post I have not gone out of my way to make sure this map works on every computer and browser.
Basically, I am leaveraging off of [Mapzen's](https://mapzen.com) awesome [Tangram](https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram/)
mapping engine to keep things simple on my end, but that means the maps will only show on modern computers
(and modern browsers, so no IE). If your computer is having trouble displaying the map just pull out your phone, chances
are it it is much better equipped to handle modern web technology.

Also, I made a bunch of choices how to display bike infrastructure. These are just a function of my personal preferences
and what OSM data has to offer. If you notice issues with the OSM data, you can fix it in OSM and it will show on the map
once the changes have filtered through to Mapzen's tile service. If you don't like my personal prefernces, just grab the
html for the map and the scene file and change it at your heart's content. You don't need any special server to host these
files, I dumped them on my static blog. Even a public dropbox folder can host these maps.

So grab the code and customize it at your heart's content. Take full control on how to display bike infrastructure and
roads, and what amenities to show and how to style them.
